This repository is not for any particular project or app, but rather my cumulative work on FreeCodeCamp. I was working on my Hanabi web app, and despite completing a lot of the front-end stuff, I realized that I did not possess the necessary skills to begin working on the backend. Therefore, I am utilizing this course to improve on my HTML/CSS/JS, and to learn about databases/servers to be able to eventually complete my Hanabi boardgame.

All of the updates are specifically on the projects section of the course, which means there might be a few days between updates whiile I'm finishing the lessons on each section. I am following pretty strictly to the guidelines, but do veer off here and there to accomodate my own creative license.

If you are currently taking the courses as well, and would like to contribute to any of my work, feel free to contact me. If this helps you, feel free to share it and follow it.
